# ROS2-Based-Turtle-Tracking-and-Catching-Simulation

🐢💻Just caught my ROS 2 project after a long time - literally!

After diving into the “ROS 2 for Beginners” course, I built a complete multi-node robot simulation from scratch: The Turtlesim “Catch Them All” Project. It may sound cute (and it is), but under the hood, it was a serious robotics challenge.

🔧 What did I build?
 An autonomous turtle (a ROS bot!) that chases down and "catches" other turtles using smart coordination between custom nodes, services, topics, and parameters - all visualized with Turtlesim. Every movement was controlled with velocity commands, service calls, and real-time decision-making. Think of it as a mini predator-prey simulator powered by ROS 2.
🧠 What I leveled up:
 ✨ Mastered core ROS 2 concepts - nodes, topics, services, parameters, launch files
 ✨ Developed in Python
 ✨ Created custom interface files
 ✨ Built scalable architecture with launch files and YAML configs
 ✨ Gained practical experience designing robot behaviors from scratch

Skills Gained: Control Systems, Robot Navigation, Robot Operating System (ROS), Autonomous Systems, Real-Time Systems and many more.

This was more than just following a course - it was about thinking like a robotics developer: designing, debugging, optimizing, and bringing it all to life.

Next up: taking these skills into building more complex robotic systems and real-world applications.
